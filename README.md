# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Boad of Elections has given the task of retrieving data from a congressional election that was recently held. 

1. Calculate the total amount of votes
1. Get a complete list of candidate names
1. Calculate the total amount of votes for each candidate
1. Calculate the percentage of votes for each candidate.
1. Calculate the county with the largest output.
1. Determine winner of congressional election based on popular vote.

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows:
- There were 369,711 votes
- The counties that took part in this election was
    -Arapahoe
    -Denver
    -Jefferson
- The candidates were:
    -Charles Casper Stockham
    -Diana DeGette
    -Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    -Charles Casper Stockham received 10.5% of the total votes with 85,213 votes.
    -Diane DeGette received 73.8% of the total votes with 272,892 votes.
    -Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of teh total votes with 11,606 votes.
- The winner of the election is Diane with 73.8% of the votes, with 272,892 votes.

## Challenge Overview
THe goal was to learn how to do basic ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) and familiarized myself with modules that effectively helped in understanding python.

### Topics experienced in this challenge.
- Import of modules to chain-link as well as open, read and write to files.
    -import os
    -import csv
- Creation of "for" loops to gather data from each row of the csv file.
- Creatiion of lists and dictionaries to store data and retrieve.
- Use of conditional statements to determine whether a logic was true or false.
    - creating variables to hold data based off the conditional statements output.
- Proper use of "f-strings" 

## Challenge Summary
Overall the challenge was easier to understand the more I started to see the patterns within the codes. I still struggle with focusing on the logic first before diving into a project. It helps that it is written out for us but I would like to have more practice practicing on putting the logic together.

### Outcomes
- Better understanding of the way in which for loops are nested and kowedge of f-strings.
- Comfortable with variables, defining dictionaries and indexing lists.

### Areas for Improvement
- Logical functions
- Open, load and saving files to folders.
- Chainlinking with the os module
